 Class Description
 Class CertDeposit approximately, models a certificate of deposit in a bank.
 Followings are the characteristics of certificate of deposit in a bank.
 1. A principal deposit is made.
 2. principal is kept in deposit for certain number of years.
 3. A fixed annual interest rate is applied.
 4. Interest is compounded with certain frequency per year.
 The formula for total money accumulation after certain number of years
 is given as follows:
 A = P*( 1 + r/q)^n*q  (^ is the power symbol)
 Where:
 A = Total accumulation after n years
 P = Initial deposit or principal
 r = Annual interest rate in decimalized fraction (not in percent)
 q = Number of times the compounding is done per year.
 n = Number of years P is left in deposit.
 Class would have data members that would allow input for P, r, n, and q,
 though we would use descriptive names rather than single letter names.
 Class would also have data members for account holders, first, last names,
 account number.
 Class member functions would include, constructors, get (accessor)
 functions for all private data members and additional querey functions.
 Class would have set functions for those data members, that may need
 safe mutation.
 Main function using the class would have a vector of CertDeposit class;
 that would need following operations from a menu driven program in
 a loop:
 1. Populate the CertDeposit vector from keyboard data entry.
 2. Print the CertDeposit vector to console and output file.
 3. Sort the CertDeposit vector based on account number.

 Blank bodies of member functions and constructors are provided below.
 All member functions have throw statements in them. Whole program will compile
 as such. You are to fill code inside the body of each function and compile
 after the code is filled. Delete throw statement once you
 start to code the body of a function.
 You must compile often to keep program in
 compiled state pretty much as you complete coding of one item. Only then
 move to next item.

 succeeded or failed. Writing to file must be done if file opening
 test shows that file is indeed successfully opened.
 3.4. Output file MUST BE CLOSED after writing to it is completed.
